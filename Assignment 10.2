10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
counts=dict()
lst=list()

for line in handle:
    if line.startswith('From '):
        words=line.split()
        word=words[5]
        word=word.split(':')
        counts[word[0]]=counts.get(word[0],0)+1
                
for k,v in counts.items():
    tup=(k,v)
    lst.append(tup)
    
lst=sorted(lst)

for k,v in lst:
    print(k,v)
